# Game-record 

Step one: Created a folder “GameRecord”, made it a git repo and add:

readme.md
app.mjs
style.css
index.html

index.html contains the basic html 5 scaffold, and includes the proper references to app.mjs and style.css


Step two:

added a games.json file under the "models" folder, mirroring the design in the example file we were given.

Step three:

Created a save function that saves a game to localStorage.  
Created a function that retrieves all games that are saved in localStorage.  
Created a function that outputs all the games as JSON.  
Created a function that can import the mentioned JSON and save all the games to localStorage.
