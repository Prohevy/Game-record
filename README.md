# Game-record 

Step one: Created a folder “GameRecord”, made it a git repo and add:

readme.md
app.mjs
style.css
index.html

index.html contains the basic html 5 scaffold, and includes the proper references to app.mjs and style.css


Step two:

added a games.json file under the "models" folder, mirroring the design in the example file we were given.

Step three:

Created a save function that saves a game to localStorage.  
Created a function that retrieves all games that are saved in localStorage.  
Created a function that outputs all the games as JSON.  
Created a function that can import the mentioned JSON and save all the games to localStorage.

Step four:

Potentially integrated a FileReader in conjunction with the code from step 3 so that the data from example.json can be imported to localStorage and created an array games, that keeps an in memory record of all the games added. 


Step five:

Wrote code that mirrored the example image, made code that is necessary in app.mjs to add a visual record in index.html of each game 

Step six: Made the play count and rating UI work. 

Step seven:

Added UI to the index.html fil that will facilitate adding a new game to the listing.

Step eight: Added code to app.mjs to make the UI from step 7 functional. (this was done with step 7)

Step Nine: Added a delete game function
